The program was interesting in the way that it combines what we learned couple weeks ago and the api. 

API Documentation

This API generates dog facts. It requires node and express installed to be run. When it's called on /facts without specifying a number, it will return all the facts available. If a number is specified, it will generate that number of random dog facts. For example, when the input is "facts?number=2" , 2 random facts will be generated. If the input number is not valid, like it is not a number, or the number is smaller than 1 or larger than the max number of facts, it will show an error message.
